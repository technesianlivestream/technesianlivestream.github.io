The TechNesian Live Stream (TLS) is not a podcast!

It's a live stream technology show by Pasifika Engineers [Ron and GT](../about/), and we don't mean "iPhone Review" Tech...

We mean, **AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker, Helm, Jenkins, CICD, Buffer Overflow and DDoS** Tech.

Our mission is to elevate and celebrate the voices of the Pacific community within the tech industry. 

We're not the diverity hire "checkbox", we're deeply technical engineers that add value to any organization that hires us, and we can hang with the best in the industry.

Join us every fortnight on the live stream where we discuss, demo and explain topics from the world of Cloud, DevOps and Cyber Security. 

You can find "Show Notes" for every stream episode on this website!
