## Tech News

The news articles we looked at on stream:

[Nearly 25,000 tech workers were laid off in the first weeks of 2024. Why is that?](https://www.npr.org/2024/01/28/1227326215/nearly-25-000-tech-workers-laid-off-in-the-first-weeks-of-2024-whats-going-on)

- Despite improved economic conditions, tech companies have collectively laid off about 25,000 employees in the first four weeks of 2024.
- The layoffs are driven by a herding effect, with companies continuing the trend to boost their stock prices and satisfy investors.
- Tech layoffs are considered contagious, with companies imitating each other to divert attention from individual failures and cover up bad investments or strategies.

[The absurdity of the return-to-office movement](https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/22/opinions/remote-work-jobs-bergen/index.html)

- corporations like Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and Meta are pushing for their employees to return to the office.
- The argument for returning to the office is often based on non-falsifiable claims about the necessity of chance encounters and spontaneous idea generation.
- There is no empirical evidence supporting these claims, and the desire for employees to be in the office seems more about control and attachment to old ways of doing things.

[AI is too expensive to replace humans in jobs right now, MIT study finds](https://www.euronews.com/next/2024/01/23/ai-is-too-expensive-to-replace-humans-in-jobs-right-now-mit-study-finds)

- The research looked into the practicalities of replacing human labour with AI in jobs in the United States where computer vision was employed, such as teachers, bakers and property appraisers.
- The MIT study indicates that AI, especially in computer vision tasks, remains too costly for widespread job replacement due to high setup and operational expenses.
- Research shows only 23% of vision task wages justify automation costs, suggesting human labour is often more economical due to AI's high initial investment.
- This study uniquely assesses the economic feasibility and technical viability of automating tasks, diverging from prior research that mainly examined AI's potential impact on job roles.

### Advice for working in the tech industry

1. Certs vs Practical Skills vs Academic

3. Certs/Skills = demonstrate ability to understand specific technology e.g. AWS, K8s.
