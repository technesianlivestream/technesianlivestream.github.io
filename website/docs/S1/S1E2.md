![Alt text](<images/theory_vs_practice.gif>)

In practice, DevOps has become an entire role that bridges the gap between Development and Operations. This new role is responsible for all the tools and processes that in theory, should be owned by both the Dev and Ops teams. 

Are we just shifting the bottleneck or is the newly created DevOps Engineer role unblocking the SDLC? It depends on company size, existing company culture, stakeholder buy-in and the DevOps tools that you use.
